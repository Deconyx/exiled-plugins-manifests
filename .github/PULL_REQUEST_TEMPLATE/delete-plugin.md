<!-- ⚠ You can delete a plugin made by you ⚠ -->

#### I want to remove my plugin because:

- [ ] The plugin was not added by me, or I do not want it to be in the public repository
- [ ] The plugin is no longer compatible with any current version of EXILED
- [ ] Another reason (specify below)

#### I know that:

- [ ] I could mark the plugin abandoned without deleting it
- [ ] Removal request can be rejected without any explanation
